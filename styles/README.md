Mugler Website

One of my favorite projects has been making my version of the Mugler website. I have been following clothing brands for a long time and recently I have been analyzing their websites as well, and I was fascinated by many of them, which is why I chose to do this project.

Besides the main page, on the website there is a page to log in or register with an email address, and from the login page, if you enter an email address, e.g. example@example.com, a password entry page follows.

From the main page, you can reach a page made to present some of the products by pressing the first explore button.
